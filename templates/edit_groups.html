well this is certainly strange... you don't appear to belong to any groups. contact your administrator (or lexigraph support, if you are an administrator).
{% else %}
You are a member of the following groups:
<table>
  <tr><th>group</th><th>members</th><th>key</th></tr>
  {% for group in groups %}
  <tr>
    <td><a href="/edit/group/{{group.name}}">{{group.name}}</a></td>
    <td>{{group.users|length}}</td>
    <td>{{group.api_token}}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
{% endif %}
