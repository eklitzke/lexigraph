welcome to the documentation. no guarantees about the accuracy of the
documentation at this point.

<h2>security model</h2>

it uses access controls, and has been thought out pretty well. more
documentation about the details goes here. https support is planned, but not yet
implemented.

<h2>api basics</h2>

<p>
the api consists of a series of pages whose paths start with <tt>/api</tt>. the
model for the api is that read requests are always http <q>get</q> requests, and
write requests are always <q>post</q> requests. the api doesn't make use of
esoteric http methods like <q>put</q> or <q>delete</q> (because you can't put
or delete actual uri entities).
</p>

<p>
all api requests require a <tt>key</tt> parameter specificying the api
key, <strong>or</strong> the request can be made by a logged in user. if you
want to share access to the api with an external entity (say, you'd like a
contractor to be able to download csv data, but otherwise not have access to
your lexigraph account) you can create a read-only account and share that api
key.
</p>

<p>a general convention adopted by most api servlets is that posted data is sent
as normal form encoded data, and data returned is returned as json. servlets
that have a different convention will explicitly specify otherwise.
</p>

<h2>uploading data</h2>
send an http post request to <tt>/api/new/datapoint</tt>. the following fields have meaning: <br/>
<table class="api_table">
  <tr><th>field</th><th>notes</th><th>interpretation</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>key</td><td></td>
    <td>the api key for a group</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dataset</td><td></td>
    <td>the name of the dataset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>value</td><td></td>
    <td>the value for the data point, should be a float</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>timestamp</td><td>(optional)</td>
    <td>the timestamp (as an integer unixtime value)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>add_point</h3>

<p>there's a simple C program called <tt>add_point</tt> that you can use as a
command line utility. <tt>add_point</tt> links against libcurl, and should work
on any unix system. you can compile it like this
(grab <a href="/files/add_point.c">add_point.c</a> first):<br />

<code>gcc $(curl-config --cflags --libs) -o add_point add_point.c</code>
</p>
<p>once you've compiled <tt>add_point</tt>, the usage is like this:<br />
<code>add_point &lt;api_key&gt; &lt;series_name&gt; &lt;float_value&gt;</code>
</p>
